Discover new packages through social delegation! 

## Installation

You can install starryeyes from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jonocarroll/starryeyes")
```

## Motivation

GitHub doesn't officially have an API endpoint for "_which of my followers starred something?_" but I wanted a way to do this. Originally I set up an IFTTT action to watch my private GitHub RSS feed and send me an email when a new star appeared, but this quickly filled my inbox.

This way, I can check in when I like.


## Usage:

1. Follow some trendsetters on GitHub.
2. Wait until they star a heap of cool repos
3. `starryeyes()` to produce a `shinydashboard` of the activity.

This will work all by itself if you're using a `GITHUB_PAT` environment variable already. If not, you can supply your GitHub `username`. You can enter your `password` or be prompted (securely) for it.

The final product looks something like this:

## Future work:

- Cache the results so they accumulate over time
- Remove duplicates (spread them out over a unique starring)

_"Oh my God! â€” it's full of stars!"_
